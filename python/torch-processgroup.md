# torch: ProcessGroup

## Definition

A `ProcessGroup` in PyTorch is an abstraction that represents a group of processes that can communicate with each other. These processes can be on the same machine or spread across multiple machines. The primary role of a `ProcessGroup` is to handle and coordinate the communication between these processes, which is essential for tasks like synchronized updates of model parameters during distributed training.

## Functions of ProcessGroup

1. **Communication Backend**: The `ProcessGroup` abstracts the communication backend (e.g., MPI, Gloo, or NCCL) used for the inter-process communication. Each backend has different capabilities and is optimized for different environments. For instance, NCCL is highly efficient on GPUs for all-reduce operations, whereas Gloo is designed for more general collective operations on both CPUs and GPUs.
2. **Collective Operations**: It supports various collective communication operations such as:
   * `all_reduce`: Reduces the tensor data across all machines in such a way that all get the result.
   * `broadcast`: Shares a tensor from one process to all other processes.
   * `all_gather`: Gathers tensors from all processes and distributes it to all.
   * `reduce`: Reduces the tensor data across all machines but only one machine gets the result.
3. **Group Management**: It manages the group of processes involved in the distributed training. This includes initializing the group, adding or removing processes, and managing the lifecycle of these processes.
4. **Synchronizing model parameters**: After each backward pass, DDP uses the `ProcessGroup` to synchronize gradients or updated parameters across all processes. This ensures that each process (and thus each model replica) stays in sync with others, maintaining consistency across the replicas.
5. **Efficiency and Scalability**: By efficiently managing the communication between processes, `ProcessGroup` helps in scaling the training process to larger models and datasets, potentially across many GPUs and machines.

## Usage

```python
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

# init_process_group initialize the communication (backend, init_method)
dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl', init_method='env://')
model = DDP(model)
```
