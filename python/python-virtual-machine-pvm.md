# Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

## Comparison: C++, Java, and Python

**C++: Direct Compilation to Machine Code**

* **Compilation Process**: C++ compilers (like GCC, Clang) compile source code directly into machine code, which is specific to the processor architecture. This results in executable files that run natively on the target system.
* **Tools for Viewing Assembly**:
  * **Compiler Flags**: Use `-S` to generate assembly code directly during the compilation.
  * **Disassemblers**: Tools like `objdump` can disassemble binaries to reveal underlying assembly instructions.
  * **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments often provide ways to view the assembly alongside high-level C++ code.

**Java: Compilation to Bytecode and JVM Execution**

* **Compilation to Bytecode**: Java source code is compiled into bytecode, a platform-independent intermediate representation, using the Java compiler (`javac`).
* **Execution by the JVM**:
  * **Interpretation**: JVM can interpret bytecode directly, converting it into machine code instruction by instruction at runtime.
  * **JIT Compilation**: Modern JVMs use Just-In-Time compilers to optimize and convert bytecode to machine code during program execution, improving performance over time.
* **Portability**: Bytecode can be executed on any machine with a compatible JVM, embodying the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

**Python: Bytecode and Interpretation or JIT Compilation**

* **Compilation to Bytecode**: Python (specifically CPython) compiles scripts into bytecode, which is an intermediate form not tied to any specific machine architecture.
* **Execution Environments**:
  * **CPython**: Interprets bytecode directly through the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This is less efficient compared to JIT compilation but simplifies the execution model.
  * **PyPy**: Includes a JIT compiler that optimizes Python execution by compiling bytecode into machine code at runtime, significantly enhancing performance for long-running processes.
* **Flexibility**: Pythonâ€™s execution method varies based on the implementation, allowing it to adapt to different performance requirements and platforms.

## PVM

PVM, aka Python interpreter.

### Architecture

* **Bytecode Generation**: Before execution, Python source code is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent intermediate representation of the Python code.
* **Interpreter Loop**: The heart of the Python VM is the interpreter loop. It fetches bytecode instructions, decodes them, and executes them sequentially.
* **Python Object Model**: The Python VM maintains a Python object model to represent data types, such as integers, strings, lists, and custom objects. It manages the creation, manipulation, and destruction of these objects during execution.
* **Memory Management:** The Python VM handles memory allocation and garbage collection to manage the memory used by Python objects dynamically.

### Bytecode execution process

* **Loading Bytecode**: The Python VM loads bytecode from the compiled .pyc files or directly from memory if the code is generated dynamically.
* **Interpreter Loop Execution:** The interpreter loop fetches bytecode instructions, interprets them, and executes corresponding operations. It maintains a stack to store intermediate values and operands.
* **Execution of Instructions:** [Bytecode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-byte-code-and-machine-code/) instructions represent operations like loading values, arithmetic computations, function calls, and control flow (e.g., jumps, loops). The interpreter executes these instructions efficiently.
* **Runtime Environment Management**: The Python VM manages the runtime environment, including namespaces, function calls, exceptions, and module imports.
