# TCP and UDP



| Basis                    | Transmission control protocol (TCP)                                                                                                                                                                                    | User datagram protocol (UDP)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Type of Service          | TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. | UDP is the Datagram-oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission. |
| Reliability              | TCP is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data to the destination router.                                                                                                                                       | The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Error checking mechanism | TCP provides extensive error-checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data.                                                                                                   | UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Acknowledgment           | An acknowledgment segment is present.                                                                                                                                                                                  | No acknowledgment segment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Sequence                 | Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in order at the receiver.                                                                                       | There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If the order is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.                                                                                                                           |
| Speed                    | TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.                                                                                                                                                                                  | UDP is faster, simpler, and more efficient than TCP.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Retransmission           | Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP.                                                                                                                                                     | There is no retransmission of lost packets in the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).                                                                                                                                                           |
| Header Length            | TCP has a (20-60) bytes variable length header.                                                                                                                                                                        | UDP has an 8 bytes fixed-length header.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Weight                   | TCP is heavy-weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | UDP is lightweight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Handshaking Techniques   | Uses handshakes such as SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK                                                                                                                                                                              | It’s a connectionless protocol i.e. No handshake                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Broadcasting             | TCP doesn’t support Broadcasting.                                                                                                                                                                                      | UDP supports Broadcasting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Protocols                | TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP and Telnet.                                                                                                                                                                      | UDP is used by DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, and VoIP.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Stream Type              | The TCP connection is a byte stream.                                                                                                                                                                                   | UDP connection is message stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Overhead                 | Low but higher than UDP.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Very low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
